    <h1>Who We Are and How We Got Here</h1>
    <p>In <i>Who We Are and How We Got Here</i>, 
      Reich allows readers to discover how the human genome 
      provides not only all the information a human embryo needs 
      to develop but also the hidden story of our species. Reich delves 
      into how the genomic revolution is transforming our understanding 
      of modern humans and how DNA studies reveal deep inequalities among 
      different populations, between the sexes, and among individuals. 
      Provocatively, Reichâ€™s book suggests that there might very well be 
      biological differences among human populations but that these 
      differences are unlikely to conform to common stereotypes.</p>
